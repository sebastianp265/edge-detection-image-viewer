# edge-detection-image-viewer

This app is an image viewer with the possibility of applying filters to an image at runtime, images dynamically change as soon as user click a checkbox or move slider at control panel. This functionality is great for seeing how image changes depending on different parameters.

App was made in Qt Creator using Qt framework and OpenCV library for image processing algorithms.

Supported features:
- zooming in/out
- applying different combination of image processing algorithms (it's very recommended to blur an image or worsen it's quality for better Canny algorithm results)
- saving processed image to a file
